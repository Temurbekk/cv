# My most up to date resume in LaTeX

## Why LaTeX?

There are a few reasons why I decided to use LaTeX to write my Resume.

1. With Google Docs, if I wanted to change format in one place, I would have to change it in multiple places

2. I heard a lot of good things about LaTeX. So, I wanted to give it a try and `I Love It!`

3. It looks cool :sunglasses:
