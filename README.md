# My most up to date resume in LaTeX

## Why LaTeX?

There are a few reasons why I prefered using LaTeX as opposed to a Google Docs

1. With Google Docs, if I wanted to change the format in one place, I would have to change it in multiple places. Also, adding a new experience or a project is a pain in the neck

2. I have heard many good things about it and so far, I don't think I was lied to

3. It sounds cool when you say you wrote your resume in LaTeX :sunglasses:
